# Upgrader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader)

Upgrader is a framework for automating the upgrade of code to handle API changes in dependent libraries.

Still under heavy development, in the first case it will provide a PoC of tooling to assist with SilverStriep 3 to 4 upgrades.

Developed by @sminnee and @tractorcow with inspiration and encouragement from @camspiers

## Install

To install globally run:

`composer global require silverstripe/upgrader`

Make sure your `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin` directory is in your PATH (or the equivalent for your OS e.g. `C:\Users\<COMPUTER NAME>\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin` on Windows).

`echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin/'  >> ~/.bash_profile`

Then you can run this script with `upgrade-code <command>` in your project root. If not running in the root,
use --root-dir=/path.
